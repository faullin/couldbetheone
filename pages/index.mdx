# Joe Faullin

Hey, I'm Joe and I work at Google. I enjoy working with great people and thinking about the future.

This portfolio is by hand for the first time (!!!) We should be **trying** some __markdown__ soon.

[**Here is my external resume**](https://vercel.com/new/git/external?repository-url=https://github.com/vercel-solutions/nextjs-portfolio-starter&project-name=portfolio&repository-name=portfolio) but reach out if you want a better picture of who I am.
